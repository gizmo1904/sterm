.SH DESCRIPTION
sterm is a minimal serial terminal that focus on being easy to use and not sucking. - This client simply works.
.br
It has inline input and supports Unicode (utf-8).
It writes whatever it receives to stdout so that also ANSI escape sequences work as expected.
.br
With the \fI--binary\fR option, the received data will be output byte wise as hexadecimal numbers.
Ideal for debugging.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display a help, version number and exit
.TP
.BR \-\-binary
Print hexadecimal values instead of Unicode characters. (Only applied on output, input will still be UTF-8)
.TP
.BR \-b " " \fIbaudrate\fB  ", " \-\-baudrate " " \fIbaudrate\fR
Define the baudrate used for receiving and transmitting.
.br
Default: 115200 baud.
.TP
.BR \-f " " \fIformat\fB  ", " \-\-format " " \fIformat\fR
Configuration-triple: xyz with x = byte length in bits {5,6,7,8}; y = parity {N,E,O}; z = stop bits {1,2}.
.br
Default: "8N1" - 8 data bits, no parity bits and 1 stop bit.
.TP
.BR \fIdevice\fR
.br
Serial I/O device to access

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
Everything OK
.TP
1
On error

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.B sterm /dev/ttyUART0

.fi
Connect to UART device with 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity bit (8N1)

.P
.B sterm --binary -b 9600 -f 7E2 /dev/ttyS0

.fi
Connect with 9600 baud, 7 data bits, 2 stop bits and even parity:
